## Group Project 1. Automatic Speech Recognition - [30 pts]

In this exercise you will be building Automatic Speech Recognition system in Russian language. In particular, given the training and validation sets, you are required to train a small NN recognizing russian spoken numbers.


### Data Description

You are provided with training and validation sets of pairs (audio, transcript) with a corresponding meta information in a form csv file as follows:

```
filename,transcription,spk_id,gender,ext,samplerate
train/0007c21c23.wav,139473,spk_E,female,wav,24000
train/000bee1b1d.wav,992597,spk_B,male,wav,24000
```

where **transcription** is a number from range `[1_000 .. 999_999]`.

There are 3 data splits with 14 unique `spk_id` from **spk_A** to **spk_N** with the following amount of audio samples in each split:
- `train/`: 12,553 samples from 6 `spk_id` 
- `dev/`: 2,265 samples from 10 `spk_id`
- `test/`: 2,265 samples all 14 `spk_id`

> NOTE: `dev/` data CAN NOT be used for trainig, but for validation purposes only

```

### Project Requirements

- Any architecture, algorithm or training baseline could be used (e.g. open-sourced pipeline or architecture)
    - However, initialization of a model from pre-trained weights is not allowed. ***Only training from scratch*** on provided training data:
      - additional training data is not allowed except the samples of noises for augmenation
      - validation split can not be concatenated to training data and provided to help you tracking the errors and overfitting

- Keep the model small - up to 5M parameters

- You can re-use your work from [personal assignments 1 and 2](../../assignments/), though this is not compulsory

- You can train a KenLM language model for LM fusion and rescoring

- Model training can be run offline using any available hardware resources


### Hints 

* When training, track the recognition error (CER/WER) per spekaer `spk_id` - this will show you if the model overfits and performs really badly on unseen voice (maybe you overparameterized your model or forgot various regularizations)

* The labeling is not normalized, meaning that direct transcription may not provide you digits directly (unless you wanna try training such setup) - what you actually hear and what is given as a label differ. You can think of applying normalization and denormalization to transcriptions

* Note that word “тысяча” is always skipped in final denormalized string output

* Don’t forget to use various audio augmentations techniques while training


### Evaluation

- Evaluation of models is held on the Kaggle platform as a code competition. Note that this is used for inference only, training of model can be performed in an offline fashion. LINK TO BE PROVIDED SOON

- The model performance will be evaluated on the holdout testing set, containing extra out-of-domain test speakers `spk_id`

- All works will be ranked according to eval metrics. Primary metric is a **harmonic mean CER** for recognized numbers for inD and ooD `spk_id`. ooD CER will be considered as a secondary metric in case of equality of the results


### Deliverables

- Kaggle Competition submission and corresponding position on the leaderboard:
    - submission notebook has to import your model and weights from GitHub

- Public GitHub repository with source code of your training pipeline and model weights (weights as a release in order to be imported in Kaggle)

- Google Classroom PDF report describing your work, experiments and results (and a history of submissions) in free form


### Resources

- For text normalization and denormalization you can use [NeMo toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing/blob/main/tutorials/Text_(Inverse)_Normalization.ipynb) or [num2words](https://pypi.org/project/num2words/)
